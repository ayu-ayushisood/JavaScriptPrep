Every time you write a program in javascript, it runs in an environment and that environment is called execution context. There are two types of execution contexts</Card.Body>

                        <Card.Body>A closure is an inner function which gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from inside even before the function is returned. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.</Card.Body>
