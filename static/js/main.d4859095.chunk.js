Every time you write a program in javascript, it runs in an environment and that environment is called execution context. There are two types of execution contexts: <ul><li>Global Execution Context</li><li>Execution Context created every time after a function is created. Every time a function is called the new execution context is pushed to the top of the global execution context, which makes an execution stack.</li></ul>An undeclared variable is assigned the value undefined at execution and is also type undefined. A ReferenceError is thrown when trying to access a previously undeclared variable.<br>Function declarations are hoisted and Function expressions are not .. gives typeError"},{"question":"<h3>JavaScript Functions</h3>","answer":"<p>2 types of JS functions</p><ol><li>Function declaration and 2.

In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.</p> <p>what happens internally is: outer function execution goes into the execution stack first, then the variables goes into symbols table. Variable remains there till the execution of the function is completed. Then comes the inner function, it goes in execution stack and can access variable from symbols table. Once the execution of outer function is completed you can&#39;t access the variable outside. Also, you can&#39;t access the variables declared inside the inner function. <code>function runExecution() { var a = 10; function add(b){ var b = 20;return a + b;} add();}</code></p><p>Further explanation to that &quot;reference&quot; concept: Point 1: &quot;An object is marked as eligible to be garbage collected when it can no longer be accessed.&quot; As you can&#39;t initiate garbage collection process manually in javascript, JS engine determines the eligibility of an object for GC using the above mentioned point. FYI, this is applicable for all types of objects.</p><p>But if there&#39;s a reference somewhere, which means if it can still be accessed (In case of closure, inner function still has reference preserved for variables defined in outer function), which means it still stays in the Heap memory &amp; garbage collector doesn&#39;t consider these variables.</p> "},{"question":"<h3>Spread and Rest operator</h3>","answer":"<p>The spread operator takes an array (or any iterable) and spreads its values.

Or 3rd party libraries like Realm"},{"question":"Why do we need Redux to store state, why not react\'s state and props?","answer":"<p>React is unidirectional. Ao to have access to a global level state, we use redux</p> <ul><li>Application\'s state is meant to be kept as small as possible and therefore, if our application is quite big and we have varous states, we should store it in a global store: redux.</li> <li>Things like authentication while login requires auth token to be saved in a global state, in that case we should use redux store. </li><li>Using redux separates business logic from design which in turn improves code readabily and maintainability</li></ul>"},{"question":"Difference between context api and redux","answer":""},{"question":"Examples of when to use redux and when not","answer":"Uncomplicated websites that do not require sibling communication or child to parent communication, should ideally not use redux. Whereas applications/websites with complex logic and with the need to communicate between siblings/from child to parent need to use a global level state like Redux."},{"question":"What is Redux flow or Redux Design Pattern ?","answer":"Call-back from UI component dispatches an action with a payload, these dispatched actions are intercepted and received by the reducers. This interception will generate a new application state. From here the actions will be propagated down through a hierarchy of components from Redux store."},{"question":"Store","answer":"The store holds the application state and supplies the helper methods for accessing the state, register listeners and dispatch actions. There is only one Store while using Redux. The store is configured via the <strong>createStorefunction</strong>. The single store represents the entire state. Rducers return a state via action <br /> <code>export function configureStore(initialState) { return createStore(rootReducer, initialState); }</code> <br /> The root reducer is a collection of all reducers in the application."},{"question":"Why is Redux Thunk used","answer":"Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState() as parameters. Thereby, middlewares like Redux Thunk or Redux Sagas are used to make the Redux asynchronous."}]}')},47:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/coding.ac092b15.jpg"},48:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/mobile-dev.ad3dfdd1.jpg"},49:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/computer-table.4fdf6d5b.jpg"},50:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/computer.a277703e.jpg"},54:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n.p+"static/media/common.122b5b53.webp"},57:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(113)},62:function(e,t,n){},63:function(e,t,n){},93:function(e,t){}},[[57,1,2]]]);
